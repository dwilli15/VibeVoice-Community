---

## Deletion Categories and Justifications

### 1. Python Cache Files (__pycache__ directories)
**Estimated Size:** 2-4 GB  
**Risk Level:** None  
**Regeneration:** Automatic on next Python execution  

**Justification:**
- Python bytecode cache files are automatically regenerated when Python modules are imported
- These directories contain compiled `.pyc` files that optimize loading speed but are not essential
- Found in every Python virtual environment and project directory
- Safe to delete as Python will recreate them as needed
- No impact on functionality, only minor impact on first-run performance

**Locations Found:**
- `D:\omen\VibeVoice-Community\.venv\Lib\site-packages\**\__pycache__\`
- `D:\omen\tools\audiblez-gui\venv\Lib\site-packages\**\__pycache__\`
- `D:\omen\tools\vibevoice_gui\__pycache__\`
- `D:\omen\VibeVoice-Community\vibevoice\**\__pycache__\`

### 2. Build and Distribution Directories
**Estimated Size:** 1-2 GB  
**Risk Level:** Low  
**Regeneration:** Via build commands (`npm run build`, `python setup.py build`)  

**Justification:**
- Build artifacts are compiled/processed versions of source code
- Can be recreated from source code using build tools
- Often contain large bundled files and optimized assets
- Taking up unnecessary space when not actively deploying

**Locations Found:**
- `D:\omen\tools\local-tts-mcp-master\node_modules\**\build\`
- `D:\omen\tools\local-tts-mcp-master\node_modules\**\dist\`
- Various TypeScript/JavaScript build outputs

### 3. Virtual Environments (Optional - High Impact)
**Estimated Size:** 3-5 GB  
**Risk Level:** Medium (time to recreate)  
**Regeneration:** `python -m venv .venv` + `pip install -r requirements.txt`  

**Justification:**
- Virtual environments contain installed Python packages
- Can be completely recreated from requirements files
- Often contain duplicate packages across multiple environments
- Large space consumers with heavy ML/AI libraries (PyTorch, Transformers, etc.)

**WARNING:** Requires significant time to reinstall packages, especially with GPU support

**Locations Found:**
- `D:\omen\VibeVoice-Community\.venv\` (3.07 GB)
- `D:\omen\tools\audiblez-gui\venv\`

### 4. Node.js Modules (Optional - High Impact)
**Estimated Size:** 2-3 GB  
**Risk Level:** Medium (time to recreate)  
**Regeneration:** `npm install` from package.json  

**Justification:**
- Node.js dependencies downloaded from npm registry
- Can be recreated from package.json and package-lock.json
- Often contain thousands of small files affecting filesystem performance
- Not needed when projects are not actively developed

**Locations Found:**
- `D:\omen\tools\local-tts-mcp-master\node_modules\` (282 packages)

### 5. Duplicate Files
**Estimated Size:** 1-3 GB  
**Risk Level:** None  
**Regeneration:** N/A (keeping one copy)  

**Justification:**
- Identical files with same content but in different locations
- Often result from copying projects or multiple installations
- Safe to remove duplicates while keeping one functional copy

**Identified Duplicates:**
1. **blis.cp311-win_amd64.pyd** (Python extension library)
   - Location 1: `D:\omen\tools\audiblez-gui\venv\Lib\site-packages\blis\`
   - Location 2: `D:\omen\VibeVoice-Community\.venv\Lib\site-packages\blis\`
   - **Keep:** VibeVoice-Community version (more active project)
   - **Delete:** audiblez-gui version
   - **Size Saved:** ~8.2 MB

2. **VibeVoice-1.5B Model Blob** (Machine Learning model cache)
   - Location 1: `D:\omen\models\hf\models--VibeVoice-Audio--VibeVoice-1.5B\blobs\`
   - Location 2: `D:\omen\VibeVoice-Community\.cache\huggingface\hub\models--VibeVoice-Audio--VibeVoice-1.5B\blobs\`
   - **Keep:** VibeVoice-Community cache (project-local)
   - **Delete:** Global models directory version
   - **Size Saved:** ~1.5 GB

3. **Multiple PyTorch/ML Library Duplicates**
   - Various shared libraries duplicated across virtual environments
   - Estimated additional savings: 500 MB - 1 GB

### 6. Temporary and Log Files
**Estimated Size:** 100-500 MB  
**Risk Level:** None  
**Regeneration:** Created as needed during operations  

**Justification:**
- Temporary files left by various applications
- Log files that may be outdated
- System cache files that can be regenerated
- No functional impact when removed

**File Types:**
- `*.tmp`, `*.temp` - Temporary files
- `*.log` - Log files (older than 30 days)
- `*.cache` - Various application caches
- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db` - OS metadata files

## Cleanup Strategy

### Phase 1: Safe Deletions (Recommended)
1. **Python caches** - Immediate space recovery, zero risk
2. **Build directories** - Medium space recovery, low risk  
3. **Duplicate files** - Good space recovery, zero functional risk
4. **Temporary files** - Small space recovery, zero risk

**Estimated Recovery:** 4-8 GB  
**Time Required:** 5-10 minutes  
**Rebuild Time:** Minimal (automatic on next use)

### Phase 2: Environment Regeneration (Optional)
1. **Virtual environments** - Large space recovery, requires rebuild time
2. **Node modules** - Medium space recovery, requires rebuild time

**Additional Recovery:** 4-7 GB  
**Time Required:** 2-5 minutes to delete  
**Rebuild Time:** 30-60 minutes depending on internet speed

## Safety Measures Implemented

1. **Backup Recommendations:** 
   - Ensure source code is committed to version control
   - Verify requirements.txt and package.json files are present
   - Test environment recreation on a subset before full cleanup

2. **Script Safeguards:**
   - `-WhatIf` parameter for preview mode
   - Individual confirmation prompts for large deletions
   - Detailed logging of all operations
   - Error handling for locked files

3. **Recovery Procedures:**
   - Virtual environments: `python -m venv .venv && pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Node modules: `npm install`
   - Python caches: Automatic on next execution
   - Build artifacts: Run project build commands

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits
- **8-15 GB** of recovered disk space
- Improved filesystem performance (fewer small files)
- Cleaner directory structure for development

### Performance Improvements
- Faster directory traversals
- Reduced backup/sync times
- Better IDE indexing performance

### Maintenance Benefits
- Easier to identify active vs. abandoned projects
- Reduced confusion from duplicate files
- Lower risk of using outdated cached dependencies

## Recommendations

1. **Execute Phase 1 immediately** - Low risk, good reward
2. **Consider Phase 2** only if additional space is needed
3. **Schedule regular cleanups** - Monthly for caches, quarterly for environments
4. **Implement gitignore patterns** to prevent future cache accumulation
5. **Use package managers responsibly** - Remove unused environments

**Script Location:** `D:\omen\VibeVoice-Community\cleanup_script.ps1`  
**Usage:** `.\cleanup_script.ps1 -WhatIf` (preview mode)  
**Usage:** `.\cleanup_script.ps1` (execution mode)  

**Note:** Always run with `-WhatIf` first to preview changes before actual deletion.
