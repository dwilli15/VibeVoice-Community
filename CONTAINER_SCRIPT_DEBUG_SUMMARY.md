- Checks Docker Compose availability
- Validates required files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml) exist

### 2. **Enhanced Container Management**
- Parameterized functions for better reusability
- Improved port cleanup logic
- Better container status reporting

### 3. **Better User Experience**
- Clear status messages with color coding
- Comprehensive error reporting
- GPU status checking for running containers

## 📊 Test Results:

### ✅ Before Fix:
```
❌ Syntax Error: Unexpected token '}' in expression or statement
❌ String termination errors due to Unicode characters  
❌ Variable reference errors with colons
❌ Script completely non-functional
```

### ✅ After Fix:
```
✅ Prerequisites check: Docker (28.3.3) ✅, Docker Compose (2.39.2) ✅
✅ Container status reporting working correctly
✅ Port status checking functional  
✅ GPU status detection operational
✅ All script actions validated and working
```
